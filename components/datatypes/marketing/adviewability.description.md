Browser environment measured at runtime describing the viewability of an advertisement or content associated with each page load.

According to [IAB/MRC definition](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MRC-Viewable-Ad-Impression-Measurement-Guideline.pdf) of Viewable Browser Space is defined as: 

> Advertisements and content associated with each
page load can appear either within or outside the viewable space of the browser
on a user’s screen—i.e., that part of the page within the browser that a user can
see. This is similar to the concepts once referred to as “Above the Fold” (i.e.,
within the viewable browser space) and “Below the Fold” (i.e., outside the
viewable browser space). The “fold” was traditionally considered to be where the
initially-loaded viewable space of the page ends – so advertisements and content
above the fold were considered likely to be viewable upon load, and for content
below the fold, it was considered necessary to scroll to in order for that content to
be viewable. In reality, the location of the fold, and consequently the viewable
status of advertising and content, is variable based on the browser settings of the
user (resolution, font size, window size, etc.) and there are generally four
locations (top, bottom, left and right sides) where advertising and content may be
cut-off from being viewable based on user actions and settings. Upon initial page
load, advertising or content placed at the top and left side of the page is most 
likely to be viewable, however this can change if content or ads are obscured by
overlays or with further user action (scrolling) coupled with latency; therefore,
placement and viewable status are separate attributes to be assessed.

Viewability details are always measured fields during runtime.

>Note regarding the applicability of these guidelines for mobile viewable ad
 impression measurement: While these viewability guidelines are primarily
 designed for desktop browser-based advertising rather than mobile advertising,
 the following points should be noted: 1) measurers of viewability of mobile
 browser-based web ads are encouraged to consider these guidelines in
 measurements until such time as guidance specifically designed for the
 measurement of viewability in mobile web based ads is created; and 2) as noted
 in the [Mobile Application Advertising Measurement Guidelines issued by IAB,
 MMA and MRC in July 2013](http://www.iab.net/inappguidelines), ad impressions
 served in an in-application environment are currently generally assumed to be
 viewable.
