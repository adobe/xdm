The option selection is either a (reusable) filter rule or a list that directly specifies the options. Usually the option is included or excluded based on tags or characteristics of the option. The filter must evaluate to true or false for any given option but independent of user profile. A simplified form of an option selection criteria is an explicit listing of the options without a separate filter query. Either an option list or an option filter rule can be specified.",
