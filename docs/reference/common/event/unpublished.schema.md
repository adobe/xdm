# Unpublished Event Schema

```
https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/event/unpublished
```

The `unpublished event` represents the activity of making an object, which was previously published, unavailable for distribution. It can be thought of as the semantic opposite of the `published event`. Some examples of the unpublished activity are, taking down digital content from a website, taking down a previously published memo from the notice board, etcetera. The [`object`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object) field should specify the object that was taken down/unpublished, whereas the [`target`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-target) field, if present, should describe where the said object was taken down from. The `unpublished event` can only be used in passive contexts. Example: the act of taking down a previously published memo from the notice board would be represented by the `unpublished` activity wherein, the memo would be the `object` of the `unpublished event` and the notice board would be the `target`.

# Unpublished Event Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Defined by |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| [@type](#type) | `const` | Optional | Unpublished Event (this schema) |
| [xdm:objectType](#xdmobjecttype) | complex | Optional | [EventEnvelope](../eventenvelope.schema.md#xdmobjecttype) |
| `*` | any | Additional | this schema *allows* additional properties |

## @type


`@type`
* is optional
* type: `const`
* defined in this schema

The value of this property **must** be equal to:

```json
"https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/event/unpublished"
```





## xdm:objectType

This is the type of the `object` that has been emitting this event. The value of this field MUST be exactly same as the value of the `object.type` field. Making the type available in the event envelope allows routing systems to dispatch events based on the object type without inspecting the object itself.

`xdm:objectType`
* is optional
* type: complex
* defined in [EventEnvelope](../eventenvelope.schema.md#xdmobjecttype)

### xdm:objectType Type


**One** of the following *conditions* need to be fulfilled.


#### Condition 1


Array type: 

All items must be of the type:
`string`
* format: `uri` – Uniformous Resource Identifier (according to [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986))





#### Condition 2


`string`
* format: `uri` – Uniformous Resource Identifier (according to [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986))
