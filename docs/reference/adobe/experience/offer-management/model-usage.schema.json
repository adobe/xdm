It serves the purpose of extracting all usages of XDM models and their properties (fields in XDM language) from an expression stored in an Eligibility Rule. \nThose expressions are a JSON formatted representation of a Profile Query Language (PQL) expression. A Schema for the JSON serialization of a PQL expression is provided in https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/filter-expression \nThe information is factored out so that clients that cannot or don't want to parse and reason about the PQL/json syntax can still process aspects of the EligibilityRule. For instance, a client that wants to know what XDM data or objects are used as input values can quickly assemble that information or aggregare it over a number of Eligibility Rules that are applied at once.\n",
