    "description": "Quota policy represents how storage consumption is managed and monitored in a given part of the repository.\nQuota is expressed as two values: _Quota Amount_ (`amount`) and _Current Consumption_ (`consumed`). The former represents a limit of storage space that can be allocated in the directory and its descendants. The latter represents the storage space that is currently allocated.\nFurthermore, _Storage Quota_ can be either _hard_ or _soft_ via the 'enforcement' property. If a _hard_ _Storage Quota_ is set, the repository implementation will not allow clients to allocate storage beyond the _Quota Amount_.\nRepository implementations can generate notifications or alerts when the consumed space in a part of the repository for which a (hard or soft) quota has been defined exceeds a given percentage (e.g. 80%) of the _Quota Amount_.\n",
