Product attributes are structured descriptions of a product that can be used in a product catalog or can be presented to the customer in a store front.

In XDM, product attributes are handled through the built-in extension mechanism, so that new product attributes can be added simply by creating a URI-scoped property.

Product attributes can take two forms: simple or structured. Simple product attributes have a key and a value, nothing else. Structured product attributes can also have a human-readable name, a unit, and be declared to be a variant attribute, i.e. an attribute which varies between product variants.
