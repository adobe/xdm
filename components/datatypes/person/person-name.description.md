The Person Name schema is used to model the full name of a person.
As the conventions for structing names differ widely across languages and cultures, names should always be modeled using the `xdm:fullName` property.
In addition, a number of optional properties are made available that can be used in situations that require using only a fragment of the full name, such as creating a formal or informal greeting.
