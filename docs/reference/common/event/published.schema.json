    "description": "The `published event` represents the activity of releasing an object for distribution. Some examples of the published activity are, publishing digital content on a website, publishing a book, publishing an article in a journal, publishing a memo on a notice board, etcetera. The [`object`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object) field should specify the object that was released/published, whereas the [`target`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-target) field, if present, should describe where the said object was published on. The `published event` can only be used in passive contexts. Example: the act of publishing an article in a journal would be represented by the `published` activity wherein, the article would be the `object` of publication and the journal would be the `target`.",
