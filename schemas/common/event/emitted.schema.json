  "description": "The `emitted event` represents the activity of emitting a message or some `object`. This event type provides the capability to conform custom activities to the XDM event envelope. A custom activity is one where the system transporting the event isn't aware of what is in the event. A custom activity typically tends to be configured by a system's end-user. Take, for example, custom OSGI events in AEM. One concern does arise regarding the `emitted event`, which is, its generic nature that allows for almost every activity to be modeled as 'message emitted' activity. This, however, is a trap that publishers of the XDM event envelope must steer away from.",
