  "description": "A tenant (see `xdm:tenant`) may work with 1..n environments where the application (see `xdm:application`) runs. Each environment serves a purpose in the CI/CD chain providing a structure whereby changes  to the application can be rolled out. Typically the owner of the application manages transitions between environments. A system integrator, partner or customer may be the owner of the application expecially where the application has  been extended and customised. An environment may have a uri referencing the definition of the environment. ",
