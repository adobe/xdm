# Web Referrer Schema

```
https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/webreferrer
```

The referrer of the web page, which is the URL a visitor came from immediately before the current web interaction was recorded.
The information in this schema is semantically compatible with the information in the HTTP `referer` header field, but allows for additional classification.

> **Note:** While the [HTTP specification](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z14) uses the term "referer", XDM follows the [Document Object Model specification ](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/level-one-html.html#ID-95229140) and uses the spelling "referrer", which is more widely accepted as the correct spelling.
