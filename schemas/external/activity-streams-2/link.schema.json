    "A Link is an indirect, qualified reference to a resource identified by a URL. The fundamental model for links is established by [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). Many of the properties defined by the Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of `[Object](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object)` or `[Link](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-link)`. When a `[Link](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-link)` is used, it establishes a [qualified relation](http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html) connecting the subject (the containing object) to the resource identified by the `[href](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-href)`. Properties of the `[Link](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-link)` are properties of the reference as opposed to properties of the resource.",
