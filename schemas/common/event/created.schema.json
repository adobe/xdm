    "A `created event` follows semantics that are exactly equivalent to the semantics described by the [`create activity`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create), except for one difference. The `create activity` can be used in imperative contexts, however, the `created event` can only be used in passive contexts.",
