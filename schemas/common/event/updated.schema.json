    "A `updated event` follows semantics that are exactly equivalent to the semantics described by the [`update activity`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-update), except for one difference. The `update activity` can be used in imperative contexts, however, the `updated event` can only be used in passive contexts.",
