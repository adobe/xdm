    "description": "A capping constraint is a way of restricting how many times an offer is proposed. These restrictions can be applied in two ways.\n\nOne of the ways is by setting a cap globally. This means that the offer won't be proposed more than the set cap. This is also referred to as volume-based capping.\n\nAnother way is by setting a cap per profile. An offer is always proposed to some profile. A marketer may want to limit the number of times the same profile sees the offer. This is also referred to as user-fatigue capping.\n\nA marketer can set both these caps on an offer at the same time.\n",
