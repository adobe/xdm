# Rejected Event Schema

```
https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/event/rejected
```

A `rejected event` follows the semantics of the [reject activity in W3C activity streams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-reject), with one notable difference.
The W3C `reject activity` can be used to express two things:

1.  either an order to reject something
2.  or the observation of a rejection

The XDM `rejected event` is only valid in the latter case, i.e. to express that something (the `object`) has been rejected by someone (the `actor`).
`target` and `origin` have no specific meaning for rejections.

Some examples of the `rejected event` include:

1.  Changes to an asset were rejected by the editor/approver.
2.  A batch processing job was rejected by a service on account of runtime errors that occurred during processing.
3.  A loan application was rejected by a financial institution.
4.  A purchase order was rejected by a firm owing to non payment of previous dues.

# Rejected Event Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Defined by |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| [@type](#type) | `const` | Optional | Rejected Event (this schema) |
| [xdm:objectType](#xdmobjecttype) | complex | Optional | [EventEnvelope](../eventenvelope.schema.md#xdmobjecttype) |
| `*` | any | Additional | this schema *allows* additional properties |

## @type


`@type`
* is optional
* type: `const`
* defined in this schema

The value of this property **must** be equal to:

```json
"https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/event/rejected"
```





## xdm:objectType

This is the type of the `object` that has been emitting this event. The value of this field MUST be exactly same as the value of the `object.type` field. Making the type available in the event envelope allows routing systems to dispatch events based on the object type without inspecting the object itself.

`xdm:objectType`
* is optional
* type: complex
* defined in [EventEnvelope](../eventenvelope.schema.md#xdmobjecttype)

### xdm:objectType Type


**One** of the following *conditions* need to be fulfilled.


#### Condition 1


Array type: 

All items must be of the type:
`string`
* format: `uri` – Uniformous Resource Identifier (according to [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986))





#### Condition 2


`string`
* format: `uri` – Uniformous Resource Identifier (according to [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986))
