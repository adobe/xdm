  "description":
    "An `EventEnvelope` is a type of `Activity` (in the sense of [W3C Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) that applies to digital experiences in general, and to entities of the Experience Data Model in particular. It is being used to track or audit changes to core entities like assets, pages, or campaigns, but also to track observed interactions of consumers of digital experiences. These observed interactions can range from simple technical loading, to passive consumption, to active engagement. Through the `EventEnvelope`, a varied set of observable entities can be tracked in a common way, enabling the establishment of publish-subscribe or event bus systems that dispatch `EventEnvelopes` based on the metadata that is part of the envelope, without having to inspect the payload `object`.",

Making the type available in the event envelope allows routing systems to dispatch events based on the object type without inspecting the object itself.",
