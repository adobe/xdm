    "description": "The `unpublished event` represents the activity of making an object, which was previously published, unavailable for distribution. It can be thought of as the semantic opposite of the `published event`. Some examples of the unpublished activity are, taking down digital content from a website, taking down a previously published memo from the notice board, etcetera. The [`object`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object) field should specify the object that was taken down/unpublished, whereas the [`target`](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-target) field, if present, should describe where the said object was taken down from. The `unpublished event` can only be used in passive contexts. Example: the act of taking down a previously published memo from the notice board would be represented by the `unpublished` activity wherein, the memo would be the `object` of the `unpublished event` and the notice board would be the `target`.",
