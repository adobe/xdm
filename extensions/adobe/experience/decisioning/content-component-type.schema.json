The placement also represents a request to produce certain types of metrics when an experience event is produced where this placement is involved. For instance the placement facilitates a personalized clickable image inside an email shown to an end-user. The placement may for instance request from the assembled experience that the click on its image gets reported in an experience event with a metric `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/metrics/web/linkclicks` and a reference to this placement.
