Content is delivered through channels (or a particular medium), but the essence of content remains independent from the devliery medium.\n\nIn [Web Content Management by Deane Barker](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/web-content-management/9781491908112/ch01.html) two key differences between content and other digital information are pointed out:\n\n> 1.  Content is _created_ differently\n> 2.  Content is _used_ differently\n\nThese differences boil down to a number of key characteristics of content.\n\n_Content is created by human editors_ in an editorial process that involves creation, revision, and publishing.\n\n_Content is created for human audiences_, which gives the content the ultimate value.\n",
