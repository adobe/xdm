    "description": "A `rejected event` follows the semantics of the [reject activity in W3C activity streams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-reject), with one notable difference.\nThe W3C `reject activity` can be used to express two things:\n\n1. either an order to reject something\n2. or the observation of a rejection\n\nThe XDM `rejected event` is only valid in the latter case, i.e. to express that something (the `object`) has been rejected by someone (the `actor`).\n`target` and `origin` have no specific meaning for rejections.\n\nSome examples of the `rejected event` include:\n\n1. Changes to an asset were rejected by the editor/approver.\n2. A batch processing job was rejected by a service on account of runtime errors that occurred during processing.\n3. A loan application was rejected by a financial institution.\n4. A purchase order was rejected by a firm owing to non payment of previous dues.\n",
